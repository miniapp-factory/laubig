+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS) – Temporal Historian: Interactive History Explorer
+1. Project Overview
+
+Temporal Historian lets users explore history like a living, interactive world. Instead of static dates and events, history “breathes”: battles unfold, inventions appear, and personalities interact. Users can explore timelines, alter minor “what-if” scenarios, and collect historical artifacts.
+
+Purpose: Make history interactive, immersive, and exploratory — blending education, storytelling, and gamification.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Interactive Timelines
+
+Explore history via dynamic timelines by region, civilization, or theme.
+
+Tap on events to see expanded details: descriptions, images, documents, and reconstructed maps.
+
+Zoom in/out to see daily, yearly, or century-level views.
+
+2.2 “What-If” Scenario Simulation
+
+Users can tweak minor historical events and see speculative consequences.
+
+AI generates narrative branches based on user changes (e.g., “If a battle had ended differently…”).
+
+Compare alternative timelines side by side.
+
+2.3 Artifact & Document Collection
+
+Unlock digital artifacts (maps, letters, inventions, portraits) by exploring events.
+
+View artifacts in high resolution; optional AR mode to place objects in the real world.
+
+Save artifacts to personal “historical museum.”
+
+2.4 Search & Exploration
+
+Search by keyword, date, location, or historical figure.
+
+Filter events by theme: Wars, Culture, Science, Politics, Discoveries.
+
+Interactive maps showing events across regions.
+
+2.5 Notifications & Daily Exploration
+
+Daily historical fact or “temporal challenge”: explore a random event or artifact.
+
+Alerts when new “artifact unlocks” or timeline expansions are available.
+
+2.6 User Profiles & Gamification
+
+Track completed explorations, unlocked artifacts, and “historical achievements.”
+
+Leaderboards for exploration streaks or artifact collections (optional social mode).
+
+Badges for mastering civilizations, timelines, or historical themes.
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+
+Platform: iOS & Android; optional web interface.
+
+Performance: Smooth scrolling through timelines; event expansion <1s.
+
+UI: Immersive, visually rich; interactive maps and timeline animations.
+
+Storage: Local DB (SQLite/Realm/Hive) for offline artifact access; optional cloud sync.
+
+4. Technical Stack
+
+Mobile Framework: Flutter or React Native.
+
+Local DB: SQLite, Realm, or Hive.
+
+Backend: Node.js/Django for cloud sync, user accounts, and artifact storage.
+
+AI: TensorFlow Lite/Core ML for “what-if” narrative generation.
+
+AR Integration: ARKit/ARCore for artifact visualization.
+
+5. Future Enhancements
+
+AI-powered historical storytelling with voice narration.
+
+Multiplayer exploration: users visit each other’s “historical museums.”
+
+VR mode to walk through reconstructed historical environments.
+
+Integration with educational platforms for classroom use.
+
+Gamified quests: “recreate a historical expedition” or “solve a mystery of the past.”
