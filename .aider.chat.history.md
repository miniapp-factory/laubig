Technical Specification (TS) – Temporal Historian: Interactive History Explorer
1. Project Overview

Temporal Historian lets users explore history like a living, interactive world. Instead of static dates and events, history “breathes”: battles unfold, inventions appear, and personalities interact. Users can explore timelines, alter minor “what-if” scenarios, and collect historical artifacts.

Purpose: Make history interactive, immersive, and exploratory — blending education, storytelling, and gamification.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Interactive Timelines

Explore history via dynamic timelines by region, civilization, or theme.

Tap on events to see expanded details: descriptions, images, documents, and reconstructed maps.

Zoom in/out to see daily, yearly, or century-level views.

2.2 “What-If” Scenario Simulation

Users can tweak minor historical events and see speculative consequences.

AI generates narrative branches based on user changes (e.g., “If a battle had ended differently…”).

Compare alternative timelines side by side.

2.3 Artifact & Document Collection

Unlock digital artifacts (maps, letters, inventions, portraits) by exploring events.

View artifacts in high resolution; optional AR mode to place objects in the real world.

Save artifacts to personal “historical museum.”

2.4 Search & Exploration

Search by keyword, date, location, or historical figure.

Filter events by theme: Wars, Culture, Science, Politics, Discoveries.

Interactive maps showing events across regions.

2.5 Notifications & Daily Exploration

Daily historical fact or “temporal challenge”: explore a random event or artifact.

Alerts when new “artifact unlocks” or timeline expansions are available.

2.6 User Profiles & Gamification

Track completed explorations, unlocked artifacts, and “historical achievements.”

Leaderboards for exploration streaks or artifact collections (optional social mode).

Badges for mastering civilizations, timelines, or historical themes.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Platform: iOS & Android; optional web interface.

Performance: Smooth scrolling through timelines; event expansion <1s.

UI: Immersive, visually rich; interactive maps and timeline animations.

Storage: Local DB (SQLite/Realm/Hive) for offline artifact access; optional cloud sync.

4. Technical Stack

Mobile Framework: Flutter or React Native.

Local DB: SQLite, Realm, or Hive.

Backend: Node.js/Django for cloud sync, user accounts, and artifact storage.

AI: TensorFlow Lite/Core ML for “what-if” narrative generation.

AR Integration: ARKit/ARCore for artifact visualization.

5. Future Enhancements

AI-powered historical storytelling with voice narration.

Multiplayer exploration: users visit each other’s “historical museums.”

VR mode to walk through reconstructed historical environments.

Integration with educational platforms for classroom use.

Gamified quests: “recreate a historical expedition” or “solve a mystery of the past.”

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to describe the logo that should be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
